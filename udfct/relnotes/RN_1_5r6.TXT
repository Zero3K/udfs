Release notes for UDF verifier release 1.5r6

Changes since previous release 1.5r4

New/modified UDF tests:

- modified test: Parent FID takes its UDF UniqueID from the (E)FE of
                 the parent directory.
- Implemented DCN-5163, approved June 2006.
- Exit status now defined to indicate errors and/or warnings, see -help text.

Further changes/corrections:

- Sparing table number correction in read error message for last sparing table
  in case of more than 1 table.

Implementation changes/corrections/remarks:

- Delete MACOS conditional code which was for Macintosh OS 9 and lower.
- Add raw_device support for Macintosh OS X and adapt Makefiles for compilation
  on Macintosh OS X. (see udf_tester/Makefile.uct for MACOSX customizing).

Known problems:

- Scsi support only accesses logical unit 0 of a drive.
- Strategy 4096 blocks may be flagged as unused blocks.
- For FE, Access, Modification and Attribute Date and Time,
  no compare (yet) to File Times EA Creation Time, if any.

------------

todo list for verifier implementation:
(incomplete list)

- double check UDF 2.50 errata tests
- complete UDF 2.60 testing and test on BD drives
- no Freed Space Bitmap/Table for access type 4.

Please inform me of errors, missing tests, etc. as soon as
