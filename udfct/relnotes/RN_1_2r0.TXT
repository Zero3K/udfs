Release notes for UDF verifier release 1.2r0

Changes since previous release 1.1r0


New/modified UDF tests:

- Added tests for new UDF 2.60 revision
- Implemented most recent UDF 2.50 errata Document
  checked: DCNs 5101,5102,5107,5108, ...
- New tests for sparse Metadata extents.
- Check blank block after VRS
- Check for empty EntityID Identifier (developer ID).
- Verify FID ICB field for Logical Block Number outside partition
  and show translation error when reading FE.
- fid->lengthOfImplementationUse must be multiple of 4, ECMA 4/14.4.6.
- Improved AVDP locations test.
- Removed max path size test for parent FIDs.
- Implemented OS Class for MAC OS X (introduced in UDF 2.50)
- Note in case an new OS Class/Identifier combination is used for older
  UDF revisions as where they are defined. In the previous verifier
  releases, this was a warning instead of a note and the test was
  applied for new OS Classes only.
- Read Unallocated Space Entry ICB (Space Table) for strategy 4096
- When verifying from an image file, for many platforms, the image
  file max chunk size has been changed from just below 2 Gbyte to
  just below 2 Terabyte. This has not been tested for all platforms.
  Please report in case of problems (Win95 ??).
  Unfortunately, platform dependent code had to be introduced, so please
  check the 'customizing' udf_tester/Makefile.uct for platform specific
  definitions (LINUX, SOLARIS, HPUX, NETBSD, IRIX64, etc.).
  Please report if platforms must be added.
- New "-chunksize <MbSize>" option to reduce the default max
  chunk size for -write_image, see "udf_test -help" for details.
- Upgraded from V2 to V3 for Linux scsi interface.
- Added "Simplified Direct-access Device", etc.

Changes/corrections:

- web site for download changed to: http://www.hitech-projects.com/udf/
- Bug repair. Verifier did not see any SCSI/atapi devices if
  host adapter zero was not used.
- Bug repairs for printing used/unused block ranges
- Bug repairs in case of a sparse extent in the metadata partition.
- Accept devices with empty vendorIdentification or productRevisionlevel
- Deliver bundled wnaspi32.dll in separate bin/win32-aspi directory
  instead of bin/win32 in order not to interfer with other versions
  of wnaspi32.dll that may already be installed.
- Because Ahead changed its company name to Nero, the bundled aspi
  licence text was adapted: changed "Ahead Software" to "Nero AG".
- Bundled new wnaspi32.dll version 2.0.1.74 by courtesy of Nero AG.
- Read buffers for -filecrc and -write_image/-inspect_image
  from 16 Mb to 32 Mb.
- In case the AVDPs at N-256 or N point to a different VDS as
  the AVDP at S+256, the AVDP with the highest address is used
  instead of the lowest as was done so far. This is beneficial for
  multisession cases where the AVDP at N-256 and N are the ones of
  the last session. (e.g. a multisession image file without
  -startsession definitions).
  It remains an error of course if the AVDPs are different.

Known problems:

- Only logical unit 0 of a drive is accessed.
- Strategy 4096 blocks may be flagged as unused blocks.
- For FE, Access, Modification and Attribute (Date and) Time,
  do not (yet) compare to File Times EA Creation Time, if any.

------------

todo list for verifier implementation:
(incomplete list)

- double check UDF 2.50 errata tests
- complete UDF 2.60 testing and test on BD drives
- no Freed Space Bitmap/Table for access type 4.
- verify Previous VAT ICB location
- UniqueID mapping table tests
- symbolic link expansion
- Timestamps in Extended Attributes
- permissions
- ...

Please inform me of errors, missing tests, etc. as soon as
possible in order to improve the verifier. Also in the case
of wrong or unclear UDF and ECMA references in messages.
