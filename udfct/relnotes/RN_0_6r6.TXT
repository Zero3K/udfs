Release notes for UDF verifier release 0.6r6

Changes since release 0.6r5

new tests:
- Check ambiguous file identifiers.

corrections:
- "FID tag spans block boundary" test for UDF 2.00 and higher only.
- continue verify after "packet length error" if packet length is not zero.
- Full path for file CRC logging and CRC in decimal and hex format.
  New format: File CRC <decimal crc>: <full path>,0x<hex crc>\n"
  Last part of format like in Osta test discs FILECRC.TXT files.

changes:
- Unicode names: Print '/' char as #002F and use of '/' char
  as path element separator in path names instead of '+' char.
  Long full path names are no longer printed on continuation lines
  but as one long line.

Todo list for verifier implementation (incomplete list)
(at least the head of this list is in priority order)

- Extended Attributes structures
- streams
- finish FID and FE testing
- File Link Count
- symbolic links
- Timestamps
- Full UniqueID testing
- allocated Space checks

Please inform me of errors, etc. as soon as possible
in order to improve the verifier. Also in the case of
wrong or unclear UDF and ECMA references in messages.
