Release notes for UDF verifier release 0.9r7

Changes since release 0.9r6

New tests, etc.:

- added FAQ.TXT file and release notes (relnotes) directory
  to verifier delivery.
- Test if sizeOfEachSparingTable in Sparable Partition Map
  allocates enough bytes for actual Sparing Table size.
- Improve messages for "missing VSR" and "missing NSR".
- New option -ignoreAVDP256. Ignores AVDP at 256. E.g. for
  verification of intermediate steps with VAT
  by: udf_test -ignoreAVDP256 -lastvalidblock <VAT address>.

Corrections:

- Repair: An error message was given for a Sparing Table with a length
  more than one block. A Sparing Table can be more than one block.
  This information was missing in the table of UDF section 5.1,
  which has been reported as an editorial repair of the spec.
- Added reference to 3.3.4.3.1 for EFE compare of Access, Modification
  and Attribute (Date and) Time to Creation Time.
- Changed error to warning for UDF 2.00 or higher with a FSD
  descriptor Version of 2 and no System Stream Directory defined.
  This may be a medium that was upgraded from UDF 1.02 or 1.50
  to UDF 2.00 or higher.
- Improved error message if VAT FE beyond partion end.
- No more fixed message limits with values >= 100
  because the default for -mlimit is 100 now.
- Ignore Data Mode as reported by the READ TRACK INFORMATION,
  because some drives do not report this well and Data Mode is in
  CD recommendations only (e.g. not defined for DVD).

Known problems:

- For drives with multiple logical units, only logical unit
  0 can be accessed.
- Strategy 4096 blocks may be flagged as unused blocks.
- For FE, Access, Modification and Attribute (Date and) Time,
  do not (yet) compare to File Times EA Creation Time, if any.

todo list for verifier implementation (incomplete list)
(at least the head of this list is in priority order)

- timeout and timeout option for the time needed to determine
  the lastvalidblock value (in case of read errors).
- Unallocated Space Descriptor checks
- verify last stream restrictions
- finish Volume Structure descriptors
- verify if unused VAT entry is #FFFFFFFF (warn or error??)
- UniqueID mapping table tests
- symbolic link expansion
- finish Volume Structure descriptors
- Timestamps in Extended Attributes
- Space Table with strategy type 4096
- permissions
- finish special UDF 2.01 tests
- ...

Please inform me of errors, etc. as soon as possible
in order to improve the verifier. Also in the case of
wrong or unclear UDF and ECMA references in messages.

Regards, Gerrit Scholl.
