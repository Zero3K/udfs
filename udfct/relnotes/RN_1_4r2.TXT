Release notes for UDF verifier release 1.4r2

Changes since previous release 1.4r0

New/modified UDF tests:

- New test for Metadata Bitmap File: (E)FE Information Length shall be
  equal to Metadata SBD size, UDF 2.2.13.2 and 2.2.13.5+6.
  Actual size (reserved) for bitmap can still be bigger than current bitmap
  size by making SBD: numberOfBytes > ROUNDUP(numberOfBits/8),
  see ECMA 4/14.12.3.
- Test minimum of 8K bytes for LVID sequence extent length for
  overwritable and rewritable media, UDF 2.2.4.6.
- Correction: Min UDF Write Revision 2.00 for UDF 2.01+ media is not always
              considered to be and error, because 'small' differences between
              UDF 2.00 and UDF 2.01.
- removed obsolete -packetlength option, use -ecclength instead.

Non-functional changes/corrections:

- Message text change: Do not mix up UDF 2.00- and UDF 2.01+ error/warning
  conditions in error/warning message for Sparable Partition Map Packet Length.

Known problems:

- Only logical unit 0 of a drive is accessed.
- Strategy 4096 blocks may be flagged as unused blocks.
- For FE, Access, Modification and Attribute Date and Time,
  no compare (yet) to File Times EA Creation Time, if any.

------------

todo list for verifier implementation:
(incomplete list)

- double check UDF 2.50 errata tests
- complete UDF 2.60 testing and test on BD drives
- no Freed Space Bitmap/Table for access type 4.
- verify Previous VAT ICB location
- UniqueID mapping table tests
- symbolic link expansion
- Timestamps in Extended Attributes
- permissions
- ...

Please inform me of errors, missing tests, etc. as soon as
possible in order to improve the verifier. Also in the case
of wrong or unclear UDF and ECMA references in messages.
