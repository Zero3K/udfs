Release notes for UDF verifier release 0.6r5

Changes since release 0.6r2

- Handle descriptors longer than the block size
- Removed warning in case last part of an Allocation Descriptors area
  is not used. Added "unused bytes" info in informal message instead.
- Continue verifying after all EntityID errors.
- Improved sparing implementation. Instead of a separate read for each
  packet, contiguous packets that have no defects are read at once.
  This may reduce the output of media with sparing by thousands of lines.
  In the previous verifier release each packet read was logged.
- First Unallocated and Freed Space descriptor checks
- Improved memory use efficiency.
- Force fake read for unrecorded extents.
- new option: -filecrc. Calculates 16-BIT file crc for FE file bodies.
  File CRC values for special file types (e.g. symbolic links)
  may not yet be correct.

Todo list for verifier implementation (incomplete list)
(at least the head of this list is in priority order)

- Read Extended Attributes
- streams
- finish FID and FE testing
- File Link Count
- symbolic links
- Timestamps
- Full UniqueID testing
- allocated Space checks
- UDF 2.01
- ...

Please inform me of errors, etc. as soon as possible
in order to improve the verifier. Also in the case of
wrong or unclear UDF and ECMA references in messages.
