Release notes for UDF verifier release 1.5r4

Changes since previous release 1.5r2

New/modified UDF tests:

- ...

Further changes/corrections:

- When comparing Metadata file to its mirror, avoid reading of unused blocks
  (they could be unrecorded).
- Far apart calculations:
  PTP: The capacity of layer L1 can be bigger than for L0. Assume
       all sectors with address greater than or equal to L0capacity
       as being on L1.
       So only Dual Layer and Single layer supported for PTP (SL, DL).
  OTP: Capacity of all layer assumed to be equal to L0capacity.
       So OTP support for DL and SL and also preparation for support of
       Multi-Layer (ML) (if assumption above is true).

Implementation changes/corrections/remarks:

- ...
TODO: add windows compile explanation to FAQ

Known problems:

- Scsi support only accesses logical unit 0 of a drive.
- Strategy 4096 blocks may be flagged as unused blocks.
- For FE, Access, Modification and Attribute Date and Time,
  no compare (yet) to File Times EA Creation Time, if any.

------------

todo list for verifier implementation:
(incomplete list)

- double check UDF 2.50 errata tests
- complete UDF 2.60 testing and test on BD drives
- no Freed Space Bitmap/Table for access type 4.
- verify Previous VAT ICB location
- UniqueID mapping table tests
- symbolic link expansion
- Timestamps in Extended Attributes
- permissions
- ...
- check DCNs: 5157, 5163, 5166 ??


Please inform me of errors, missing tests, etc. as soon as
possible in order to improve the verifier. Also in the case
of wrong or unclear UDF and ECMA references in messages.
