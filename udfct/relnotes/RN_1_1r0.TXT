Release notes for UDF verifier release 1.1r0

Changes since previous release 1.0r5

Corrections:

- UDF 2.50 bug repair: AED descriptors of normal files must be in Metadata Partition.

New tests, etc.:

- Actual length of a virtual partition is the number of entries in the VAT table,
  instead of the length of the underlying partition on which the Virtual partition
  is mapped.
- Verify partition allocation for a virtual partition. Unallocated blocks in a
  virtual partition must be marked as #FFFFFFFF in the corresponding VAT entry.
- New command line option -usemirror for UDF 2.50.
  Uses Metadata Mirror File instead of Metadata File for Metadata Partition.
- Make distinction between last valid block and last recorded block addresses.
  This may be relevant for unfinalized and background formatting media.
- Do not read in unrecorded gaps (after last recorded address, between tracks
  and Free Blocks or padding blocks at end of track).
- New -readgap option that forces reading in unrecorded gaps.
- -showalloc layout changed: used and unsused ranges in one table.
- Error if partition starts in first 32K of Volume space and warning if it
  starts at an address less than 257.
- Use GET CONFIGURATION and READ DVD STRUCTURE info instead
  of obsolete Mode SENSE info
- Switch off FUA bit for SCSI READ in order to use drive cache, this
  makes the verifier much faster on many drives.
- define and test Scsi Api Version (udf_scsi.dll for Win32) in order
  to notice mismatch on API changes.
- For LINUX/NETBSD scsi support: restricted the device range for
  -showscsi and -scsi <h>:<s> in order to avoid too long execution times.
  NOTE: -scsi /dev/* works for all values of * for scsi/atapi devices.
- Win32 compilation with Studio.net 7.1 instead of Studio 6.

Known problems:

- For drives with multiple logical units, only logical unit
  0 can be accessed.
- Strategy 4096 blocks may be flagged as unused blocks.
- For FE, Access, Modification and Attribute (Date and) Time,
  do not (yet) compare to File Times EA Creation Time, if any.
- Space Table with strategy type 4096 not implemented

------------

todo list for verifier implementation:
(incomplete list)

- complete UDF 2.50 testing
- no Freed Space Bitmap/Table for access type 4.
- timeout and timeout option for the time needed to determine
  the lastvalidblock value (in case of read errors and -readgap).
- verify last stream restrictions
- verify Previous VAT ICB location
- UniqueID mapping table tests
- symbolic link expansion
- finish Volume Structure descriptors
- Timestamps in Extended Attributes
- Space Table with strategy type 4096
- permissions
- ...

Please inform me of errors, missing tests, etc. as soon as
possible in order to improve the verifier. Also in the case
of wrong or unclear UDF and ECMA references in messages.
