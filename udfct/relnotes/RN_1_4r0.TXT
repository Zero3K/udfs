Release notes for UDF verifier release 1.4r0

Changes since previous release 1.3r0

New/modified UDF tests:

- Implemented DCN-5153: Modification, Access and Attribute Date and Time
  warning instead of error when earlier than Creation Date and Time.
- Added test: UDF 2.00 and higher should use EFE instead of FE
- Blank-sector-after-VRS violation is always an error for UDF 2.01 and higher
  revisions (was sometimes a warning if exact UDF revision not yet known).
- Repaired file link count test bug for hard links with stream dir
- Added test for illegal nested stream directory ICB of System Stream Dir.
  This changed the order of tree walk. Streams attached to directories are
  expanded just before the directory itself is expanded.
- changed warning to note for use of long_ad for Metadata Bitmap File.
- Added Minimum/Maximum UDF Read/Write Revision tests. In the UDF 1.50 VAT
  case, the nmb of files/directiries and min/max UDF read/write revisions
  from the Open LVID are shown but only the min/max read/write revisions
  are tested.

Non-functional changes/corrections:

- Running platform and scsi support indication in logging.
- Commented out 'unreachable breaks' and some other adaptations to avoid
  warnings messages for some compilers.
- removed __cdecl  (not used / default)
- Removed obsolete LINUX sg_header/SCSI_OFFSET scsi method code.

Known problems:

- Only logical unit 0 of a drive is accessed.
- Strategy 4096 blocks may be flagged as unused blocks.
- For FE, Access, Modification and Attribute Date and Time,
  no compare (yet) to File Times EA Creation Time, if any.

------------

todo list for verifier implementation:
(incomplete list)

- remove obsolete -packetlength option.
- double check UDF 2.50 errata tests
- complete UDF 2.60 testing and test on BD drives
- no Freed Space Bitmap/Table for access type 4.
- verify Previous VAT ICB location
- UniqueID mapping table tests
- symbolic link expansion
- Timestamps in Extended Attributes
- permissions
- ...

Please inform me of errors, missing tests, etc. as soon as
possible in order to improve the verifier. Also in the case
of wrong or unclear UDF and ECMA references in messages.
