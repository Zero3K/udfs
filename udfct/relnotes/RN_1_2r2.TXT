Release notes for UDF verifier release 1.2r2

Changes since previous release 1.2r0


New/modified UDF tests:

- Correction of LVID Free Space test for pseudo-overwritable partition

- Changed most cases of metadata 'far apart' violation from a Warning to
  a Note for the moment, because this is not well defined and there are
  some situations where this is hard to achieve, like for multisession,
  multilayer, POW, ...
  Maybe later conditionally change the Note back to a Warning.
  Test margin for Note: MAX( 1000, 25% of verify session space )
                  [was: MAX( 1024, 25% of volume space )]
  A warning will be generated if there are only 10 or less
  (ECC) packets in between any block allocated for the Metadata File
  and the ones allocated for its mirror (this is not yet implemented
  fully for all 'overlapping' cases).
Note:
  The warning case may be extended, because this is a real minimum.
  Further the test will also be used for 'far apart' of Main VDS and
  Reserve VDS, which is not tested yet at the moment.

Changes/corrections:

- if INQUIRY fails, then retry it after successful TEST UNIT READY
- removed some obsolete dead code

Known problems:

- Only logical unit 0 of a drive is accessed.
- Strategy 4096 blocks may be flagged as unused blocks.
- For FE, Access, Modification and Attribute (Date and) Time,
  do not (yet) compare to File Times EA Creation Time, if any.

------------

todo list for verifier implementation:
(incomplete list)

- double check UDF 2.50 errata tests
- 'far apart' test for Main and Reserve VDS.
- complete UDF 2.60 testing and test on BD drives
- no Freed Space Bitmap/Table for access type 4.
- verify Previous VAT ICB location
- UniqueID mapping table tests
- symbolic link expansion
- Timestamps in Extended Attributes
- permissions
- ...

Please inform me of errors, missing tests, etc. as soon as
possible in order to improve the verifier. Also in the case
of wrong or unclear UDF and ECMA references in messages.
