Release notes for UDF verifier release 1.0r1

Changes since release 0.9r7

New tests, etc.:

- First implementation of UDF 2.50 read functionality
  and basic testing. However, many UDF 2.50 specific
  tests are not yet implemented.
- Verify FID Padding bytes to be #00.
- A SGI binary is added to the delivery in the bin/sgi64 directory

Corrections:

- The consistent use of tagSerialNumber zero for all
  descriptors is no longer a "Warning:" but a "Note:"
- After an error in an FSD or LVID sequence, the verifier will
  continue verifying with the last prevailing FSD/LVID, if any.
- Avoid 'modification time errors' if more that one LVID in an
  LVID sequence, e.g. for strategy 4096.

Known problems:

- Many tests for UDF 2.50 are not yet implemented
- For drives with multiple logical units, only logical unit
  0 can be accessed.
- Strategy 4096 blocks may be flagged as unused blocks.
- For FE, Access, Modification and Attribute (Date and) Time,
  do not (yet) compare to File Times EA Creation Time, if any.
- Space Table with strategy type 4096 not implemented

------------

todo list for verifier implementation:
(incomplete list)
(at least the head of this list is in priority order)

- add specific UDF 2.50 tests
- timeout and timeout option for the time needed to determine
  the lastvalidblock value (in case of read errors).
- Unallocated Space Descriptor checks
- verify last stream restrictions
- finish Volume Structure descriptors
- verify if unused VAT entry is #FFFFFFFF (warn or error??)
- UniqueID mapping table tests
- symbolic link expansion
- finish Volume Structure descriptors
- Timestamps in Extended Attributes
- Space Table with strategy type 4096
- permissions
- finish special UDF 2.01 tests
- ...

Please inform me of errors, etc. as soon as possible
in order to improve the verifier. Also in the case of
wrong or unclear UDF and ECMA references in messages.
