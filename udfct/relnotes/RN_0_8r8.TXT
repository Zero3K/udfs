Release notes for UDF verifier release 0.8r8

Changes since release 0.8r6

- Check overlap of Volume Structures with partition space.
  If overlap, then check allocation in partition Space Set.
- Check Non-Allocatable Space.
- Detect all occurences of multiple allocated blocks inside
  a partition. Also Volume structures that may overlap with
  a partition are taken into account.
- Check number of AVDPs in a later stage after it is clear if
  a virtual partition is present for better error messages in
  case of a single AVDP.
- Complete Dstring and FID identifier tests, handle compression
  id 254 and 255 for deleted FIDs.
- Allow ambiguous deleted FID names for UDF 2.01+,
  but print warning for UDF 2.00 and lower.
- Handle REAL TIME FILE type for UDF 2.01
- Verife UDf domain identifiers in LVD and FSD.
- Detect sessions in scsi/atapi support for a CD medium and
  verify last data session by default.
- Improved final status report:
  Shows final medium type, etc.
  Extra fatal error in case verification could not be completed
- Improved directory listing: add mark for System, Non-Relocatable
  and Contiguous bits, remove 'R' for Reserved bits, see -help.
- Always extract medium type information from file system
  structures, so ignore that type of information reported
  by a drive and remove the following medium type command
  line options: "-readonly -writeonce -rewritable"
                "-sequential -nonsequential"
                "-closed -unclosed"
  get medium type info from:
    writability type: from partition(s) access type, so also
                      state "overwritable" is possible.
     sequential type: presence of a virtual partition
     closed/unclosed: presence of a single AVDP on 256 or 512,
                      relevant for sequential only.
     renamed closed/unclosed to finalized / unfinalized.
- Added heuristics by checking VAT and AVDP positions near the
  end of the medium in order to find the correct value of the
  last valid block number N.
  Can still be overruled by -lastvalidblock option.
  This makes the verifier less drive dependent, because
  sometimes different values for N were reported by different
  drives for the same medium.
- changed "- ==> Note: Previous message print..., ignored from now."
  message to:            "- ==> Message print..., ignored from now."
  in order to make it easier to trace other notes with a search
  for "Note:"
- Low level scsi error logging switched off
- macos.mpr project file replaced by updated macos.pro5 file.

Corrections:

- The warning for OSes that do not support the notion of
  Uid/Gid based on ECMA 4/14.9.2+3 is chandged into an error
  based on the more strict definition of UDF 3.3.3.1+2.
  OSes that do support the notion of Uid/Gid are the OS
  Classes 4 and 7 ("UNIX" and "OS/400"), according to UDF 6.3.
  So there are no Uid/Gid restrictions for these OS Classes,
  all other OS Classes shall use #FFFFFFFF as Uid/Gid.

Known problems:

- For drives with multiple logical units, only logical unit
  0 can be accessed.
- Continuation extents and Strategy 4096 blocks may be
  flagged as unused blocks.

todo list for verifier implementation (incomplete list)
(at least the head of this list is in priority order)

- UniqueID testing by cross reference of all FID/FE
- UniqueID mapping table tests
- verify last stream restrictions
- symbolic link expansion
- finish FID and FE testing
- finish Volume Structure descriptors
- Timestamps in Extended Attributes
- Unallocated Space Descriptor checks
- Space Table with strategy type 4096
- permissions
- finish UDF 2.01 tests
- ...

Please inform me of errors, etc. as soon as possible
in order to improve the verifier. Also in the case of
wrong or unclear UDF and ECMA references in messages.
