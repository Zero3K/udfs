Release notes for UDF verifier release 0.9r6

Changes since release 0.9r5

- Reduced memory usage by more than 50%, especially in
  case of huge number of files and directories.
- Change -mlimit default from infinite to 100. At most
  100 occurentces of each error or warning are printed.
- Show "Summed file body sizes" in final status report.
- For -filecrc option, show "Overall file body CRC"
  in final status report. For details, see -filecrc
  description in 'udf_test -help' output
- Verfifier refuses to allocate more than 16 Mbyte for
  a descriptor or bitmap, e.g. in case of an erroneous
  huge partition size.

Corrections:

- Print "Last modification time" in LVID/VAT status summary
  in local time instead of UCT.
- ...

Known problems:

- For drives with multiple logical units, only logical unit
  0 can be accessed.
- Strategy 4096 blocks may be flagged as unused blocks.

todo list for verifier implementation (incomplete list)
(at least the head of this list is in priority order)

- timeout and timeout option for the time needed to determine
  the lastvalidblock value (in case of read errors).
- Unallocated Space Descriptor checks
- verify last stream restrictions
- finish Volume Structure descriptors
- verify if unused VAT entry is #FFFFFFFF (warn or error??)
- UniqueID mapping table tests
- symbolic link expansion
- finish Volume Structure descriptors
- Timestamps in Extended Attributes
- Space Table with strategy type 4096
- permissions
- finish special UDF 2.01 tests
- ...

Please inform me of errors, etc. as soon as possible
in order to improve the verifier. Also in the case of
wrong or unclear UDF and ECMA references in messages.

Regards, Gerrit Scholl.
