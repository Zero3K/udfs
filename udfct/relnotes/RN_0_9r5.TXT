Release notes for UDF verifier release 0.9r5

Changes since release 0.9r2

- Improved Partition Map and File Type testing.
- Test on icbtag.parentICBlocation field.
- Corrections of byte posistion (BP) in IcbTag messages.
- Correction of LVID/VAT "Number of Files" and "Number of
  Directories" tests. "Marked for Delete" files and direcories
  must not be counted.
- Warning instead of an error if packet Length is overruled
  by a value that is a multiple of the previous value.
  E.g. for UDF 2.00 and lower when a packet length of 16 from a
  DVD medium is overruled bij a value of 32 from the Sparing Table.
- finished PD verification.
- verify Min/Max UDF Revision range
- Show permissions in directory listing. Can be supressed
  by new "-noperm" option.
- -inspect_image: more strict test for Sparing Table,
  Often too many Sparing Tables were shown.
- Hex numbers for Tag Checksum error.
- If scsi/atapi device initialization fails and -lastvalidblock <x>
  is defined, then try to access the device anyway using N = <x>.
- Use MMC-3 terminology, Mt. Fuji incorporated in MMC-3 now.

- Bug repair in timestamps time comparison.
  It is unimaginable that nobody reported this bug.
- Test if medium Last Modification Time (LVID or VAT)
  is not in the future.
- Reshuffle of messages and actions involved with Timestamp time
  comparison when at least one Timestamp has an undefined timezone.
  Time comparison is now also executed if one timezone is undefined
  and the other is not. This seems to be the best solution because
  both are supposed to be 'local time' according to UDF, 2. Basic
  Restrictions & Requirements.
  Only one warning for this at the end of verifier output. No warning
  count for every occurrence (sometimes thousands) as in previous
  verifier release. Warning text:
    Warning: At least one Timestamp with an undefined timezone
             was involved in a Timestamp time comparison.
      For a time comparison where at least one undefined timezone
      is involved, the timezone values are ignored.
- Changed timestamp message: "t1 shall not be earlier than t2"
                         to: "t2 shall not be later than t1".

Download packet Changes:

- Adapted ASPI.TXT because of obsolete link.

Known problems:

- For drives with multiple logical units, only logical unit
  0 can be accessed.
- Strategy 4096 blocks may be flagged as unused blocks.

todo list for verifier implementation (incomplete list)
(at least the head of this list is in priority order)

- Unallocated Space Descriptor checks
- UniqueID mapping table tests
- verify last stream restrictions
- symbolic link expansion
- finish Volume Structure descriptors
- Timestamps in Extended Attributes
- Space Table with strategy type 4096
- permissions
- finish special UDF 2.01 tests
- ...

Please inform me of errors, etc. as soon as possible
in order to improve the verifier. Also in the case of
wrong or unclear UDF and ECMA references in messages.
