Release notes for UDF verifier release 0.5r4

Release 0.5r1 contained a bug in the -write_image option
for some OSes. No problem for UNIX, but problems on Windows 95/98
and maybe Windows NT.
If you created image files using the verifier 0.5r1, please redo
using this release 0.5r4.

Changes since previous release 0.5r1

- Repaired -write_image bug for writing blank blocks
  on some platforms.
- Summary correction for -inspect_image.
- Some corrections and additions during the OSTA plugfest.
- Added a directory bin/win32-i386-noscsi to the delivery
  containing a verifier binary compiled with NO_SCSI,
  which means that it can only read from an image file
  and does not need udf_scsi.dll and wnaspi32.dll.

Not yet included in the verifier (incomplete list) :

- Sparing
- handle descriptors longer than the block size.
- File Link Count
- Extended Attributes
- Timestamps
- Full UniqueID testing
- allocated Space checks
- streams
- ...

First foreseen additions:

- Sparing
- descriptors longer than the block size.
- Complete the tests for FID and File Entry.

Please inform me of errors, etc. as soon as possible
in order to improve the verifier. Also in the case of
wrong or unclear UDF and ECMA references in messages.
