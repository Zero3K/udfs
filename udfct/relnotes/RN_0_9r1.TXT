Release notes for UDF verifier release 0.9r1

Changes since release 0.8r8

- LVID and related VAT verification, free space,
  nmb of files, etc.
- Compare two timestamps with both an undefined timezone
  as if both in same timezone. Still "Cannot compare"
  warning if only one of them has undefined timezone.
- Verify Descriptor Version values, note in final status
  report if mix of values 2 and 3 was found.
- Verify missing or unexpected Space Set.
- Verify virtual extent greater than the block size.

Corrections:

- ICBtag flags for Non-Allocatable Space was too strict,
  test only System bit and Allocation Descriptor type.
- In some cases, take the last valid block value N from the
  "READ CD RECORDED CAPACITY" information, instead of the
  "READ TRACK INFORMATION, (improvement for closed DVD-R).
- Only read track info for Disc Status "Complete" or
  "Incomplete". (improvement for some DVD-RAM).
- UDF/ECMA references in Partition or Non-Allocatable
  Space overlap messages.
- Message limit from 2 to 10 for Uid, Gid error message.
- Avoid some error double counting.
- repaired known problem of allocation tests for
  continuation extents.

Known problems:

- For drives with multiple logical units, only logical unit
  0 can be accessed.
- Strategy 4096 blocks may be flagged as unused blocks.

todo list for verifier implementation (incomplete list)
(at least the head of this list is in priority order)

- UniqueID testing by cross reference of all FID/FE
- UniqueID mapping table tests
- verify last stream restrictions
- symbolic link expansion
- finish FID and FE testing
- finish Volume Structure descriptors
- Timestamps in Extended Attributes
- Unallocated Space Descriptor checks
- Space Table with strategy type 4096
- permissions
- finish UDF 2.01 tests
- ...

Please inform me of errors, etc. as soon as possible
in order to improve the verifier. Also in the case of
wrong or unclear UDF and ECMA references in messages.
