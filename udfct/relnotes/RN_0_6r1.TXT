Release notes for UDF verifier release 0.6r1

The main change is implementation of sparing and
Sparable Partition Map and Sparing Table checks.
This means that images and media using sparing can now
make full use of the verifier as for other UDF media
and that sparing is checked.

Changes since previous release 0.5r4

- Sparing implemented and most Sparing tests in place.
- No more default packet length, read from device or
  sparable partition map. Zero if undefined.
- Changes reported by Cary Boyd to keep Mac compiler happy.

Todo list for verifier implementation (incomplete list)
(at least the head of this list is in priority order)

- Complete Sparing Table Mapped Location tests
- handle descriptors longer than the block size.
- streams
- Extended Attributes reading.
- finish FID and FE testing
- File Link Count
- symbolic links
- Timestamps
- Full UniqueID testing
- allocated Space checks
- ...

Please inform me of errors, etc. as soon as possible
in order to improve the verifier. Also in the case of
wrong or unclear UDF and ECMA references in messages.
