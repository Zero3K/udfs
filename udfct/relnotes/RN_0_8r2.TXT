Release notes for UDF verifier release 0.8r2

Changes since release 0.8r1

main changes:

- Full File Link Count verification.
- Error and warning count in final status report.
  In non-UDF warnings, changed "Warning:" to "Note:"

Corrections:
- For UDF 1.50 and lower:
  FID ICB field does not contain a UDFUniqueID,
  it was introduced in UDF 2.00.
- For UDF 2.00 and higher:
  No more compare of UDFUniqueID when verifiying if the
  parent FID correctly identifies the appropriate parent.
  Waiting for correct interpretation of the UDF spec about
  how the UDFUniqueID of a parent FID shall be set.
- proper warning instead of assert for unexpected
  File Entry while Volume Descriptor expected.
- timestamp ECMA reference corrections.
- bug repair for 'partition out of range error message'.

todo list for verifier implementation (incomplete list)
(at least the head of this list is in priority order)

- UniqueID testing by cross reference of all FID/FE
- UniqueID mapping table tests
- verify last stream restrictions
- symbolic link expansion
- finish FID and FE testing
- finish Volume Structure descriptors
- Timestamps in Extended Attributes
- Unallocated Space Descriptor checks
- Space Table with strategy type 4096
- permissions
- finish UDF 2.01 tests
- ...

Please inform me of errors, etc. as soon as possible
in order to improve the verifier. Also in the case of
wrong or unclear UDF and ECMA references in messages.
