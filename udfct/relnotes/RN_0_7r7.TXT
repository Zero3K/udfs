Release notes for UDF verifier release 0.7r7

Changes since release 0.7r5

main changes: Far better windows drive support and multi-file
              abstraction for image file.

- Drive support for windows is enhanced. Tested for several MMC-1 drives
  that show up as scsi (CD, DVD, MO), also IDE Atapi devices.
  Backwards compatible with older drives that were supported by previous
  verifier releases. Please report if your drive does not work with this
  release of the verifier.
  Use commands:
   udf_test -showscsi
        Last lines of output from this command are most important.
        They show the host adapter and scsi id of devices possibly
        containing UDF.
   udf_test -scsi <h>:<s>        e.g.: udf_test -scsi 3:1
        Verify UDF on device with host adapter <h> = 3 and scsi id <s> = 1

- Number of bytes to read from a device at once is reduced from 64 Kbyte
  to 32 Kbyte, because the Adaptec APA-1480 PCMCIA card hangs on 64 Kbyte.

- Multiple file abstraction for image file in order to circumvent maximum
  file size (and maximum file system partition size) limitations.
  1) Image file argument can now be a list of files that are the chunks of
     the total image file. Each chunk file has a size that is a multiple
     of the block size and is less than 2 Gbyte (2*1024*1024*1024 bytes).
     The total UDF image file to be verified is the concatenation of all
     the chunk files in the list.
     example: udf_test a:\chunk01.img b:\chunk02.img c:\chunk03.img
  2) The -write_image utility does write the output image file in chunks of
     less than 2 Gbyte, as defined above. Using the -start and
     -lastvalidblock options, any part of the input image can be written out.

- A new "-start <startblock>" option is introduced and the <start> argument
  of the -inspect_image option is removed.
  "-start <startblock>" can only be used to define the start block for the
  -write_image and -inspect_image options.

For details see: udf_test -help

corrections:
- change text for AED CRC length exception
- repair media type setting bug
- ignore system stream directory Unique ID.
- UDF 2.01 is now a legal UDF release (-udf 2.01).
  Not all 2.01 tests are yet in place.

todo list for verifier implementation (incomplete list)
(at least the head of this list is in priority order)

- verify stream restrictions
- Space Tables for partition allocation checks
- File Link Count for non-directory FEs
- finish FID and FE testing
- Unallocated Space Descriptor checks
- symbolic link expansion
- Timestamps
- permissions
- Full UniqueID testing
- Finish UDF 2.01 tests
- ...

Please inform me of errors, etc. as soon as possible
in order to improve the verifier. Also in the case of
wrong or unclear UDF and ECMA references in messages.
