Release notes for UDF verifier release 0.8r1

Changes since release 0.7r7

main changes:

- Timestamp verification (not yet in Extended Attributes).
- more directory listing info:
  . File Link Count
  . modification time (UCT or local time)
  . file size.
  . full info for <parent FID> entry.
  see 'udf_test -help' output for details.
- new -localtime option to show local time and time zone instead of UCT.
- more FID and FID/File Entry consistency tests.
- more stream restrictions tests.
- show FID file identifier with all FID messages
- Check Space Tables partition allocation,
  not yet: Space Table with strategy type 4096.
- more drive track information logging
- new Linux device support, this caused a small
  change in the device abstraction interface.
  (moved Device.impUse.MediumInfo to Device.MediumInfo).
  Mind NEW definition of: PLATFORM = -DLINUX
  for Linux platforms, see next point.
- all Unix-like Makefile customizing concentrated in
  one file: udf_tester/Makefile.uct. This file is
  included by all other Makefile files.
  Tests performed on Linux and Sun.

Corrections:
- read Reserve VDS after error in Main VDS
- some basic descriptor tag errors were not printed, corrected.
- inspect_image summary bug repair
- Tag Checksum error is not always fatal
- single block read retry for medium read errors.

todo list for verifier implementation (incomplete list)
(at least the head of this list is in priority order)

- verify last stream restrictions
- File Link Count for non directory FEs
- UniqueID testing
- symbolic link expansion
- finish FID and FE testing
- finish Volume Structure descriptors
- Timestamps in Extended Attributes
- Unallocated Space Descriptor checks
- Space Table with strategy type 4096
- permissions
- finish UDF 2.01 tests

Please inform me of errors, etc. as soon as possible
in order to improve the verifier. Also in the case of
wrong or unclear UDF and ECMA references in messages.
