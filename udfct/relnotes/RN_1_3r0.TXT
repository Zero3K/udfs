Release notes for UDF verifier release 1.3r0

Changes since previous release 1.2r2


New/modified UDF tests:

- Implemented 'far apart' calculations for Metadata/Mirror files and
  Main/Reserve VDS also for both DL OPT and DL PTP cases.
  So the layout of a DL disc is taken into account where sectors can be
  physically 'nearby' on the medium while the sector address difference
  is huge and the other way about (e.g. for PTP).
  The base size for these calculations is the Volume Space for the single
  layer case and the Layer zero capacity for the DL case.
  The 'remaining base size' is the 'base size' minus the allocations itself
  (e.g. for the Metadata file and its mirror).
  In all cases a 'far apart' summary is shown with the lowest ECC packet
  distances and LBAs of allocations for e.g. the Metadata File and mirror.
  Further, a warning is printed if the distance is less than 10 percent of the
  above mentioned 'remaining base size' and a note if less than 25 percent.
  Layer zero capacity and PTP/OTP is read from the medium or from the new
  -L0capacity <n> and -PTP options (options e.g. for verifying image files).
  The LO capacity must be an integer multiple of the ECC blocking factor and
  at least half the Volume Space.

- New -L0capacity <n> option for multi layer 'far apart' 'physical distance'
  calculations. <n> is the Layer zero capacity in sectors and shall be an
  integral multiple of the ECC blocking factor and at least half the Volume
  Space. The default for -L0capacity <n> is OTP (Opposite Track Path).
- New -PTP option for multi layer 'far apart' 'physical distance' calculations.
  -PTP defines a Parallel Track Path, the default is Opposite Track Path (OTP).
  If no -L0capacity <n> option is defined, -PTP is ignored.

- Introduce intermediate state for single AVDP on a medium with background
  formatting not complete (e.g. DVD+R, UDF 6.13.2.2).

- Always show Information Length value in directory listing
  (also if less bytes are allocated in the file body)

- Change SBD CRC Length "8 is recommended" warning to a Note
  for UDF revisions of 2.01 and lower.

- Show all relevant icbtag Flags bits in directrory listing such as:
  allocation type, Archive, Setuid, SetGid, Sticky and Stream bits.
  For changed layout, see -help option output text.

- Use AVDP with lowest address (normally AVDP at 256).
  (This means back to situation as for verifier release 1.1r0 and lower.
   Reading AVDP at 256 can still be avoided by using the '-ignoreAVDP256'
   command line option.)

- Untangle ECC blocking factor and Sparing Packet Length usage,
  therefore:
- New "-ecclength <n>" option replaces "-packetlength <n>" option.
  "-packetlength" will become obsolete !!!!


Changes/corrections:

- (crash) bug repair for weird metadata mirrow allocation.
- Bug repair for realloc problem coming to the surface on NetBSD
  (thanks to Reinoud Zandijk).
- remove unreachable debug code.
- Replace most of the message printing macros by functions,
  thus reducing the verifier footprint.

Known problems:

- Only logical unit 0 of a drive is accessed.
- Strategy 4096 blocks may be flagged as unused blocks.
- For FE, Access, Modification and Attribute (Date and) Time,
  do not (yet) compare to File Times EA Creation Time, if any.

------------

todo list for verifier implementation:
(incomplete list)

- check outcome DCN-5152
- remove obsolete -packetlength option.
- double check UDF 2.50 errata tests
- complete UDF 2.60 testing and test on BD drives
- no Freed Space Bitmap/Table for access type 4.
- verify Previous VAT ICB location
- UniqueID mapping table tests
- symbolic link expansion
- Timestamps in Extended Attributes
- permissions
- ...

Please inform me of errors, missing tests, etc. as soon as
possible in order to improve the verifier. Also in the case
of wrong or unclear UDF and ECMA references in messages.
