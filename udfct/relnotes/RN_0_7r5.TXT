Release notes for UDF verifier release 0.7r5

Changes since release 0.7r1

corrections:

- Bug repair for file link count of directories with a streamdirectory.

new tests:

- Streams read implementation ready. All stream directories are
  expanded and all streams read.
  Special restrictions for streams not yet verified.
  In a file name or file path, streams and stream directories
  are denoted with a double /. like: "filename"//"streamname".
  <root>//"streamname" is equivalent with ///"streamname" for
  a named stream attached to the root directory.
- Partition allocation checks. Space Tables not yet implemented.
  1) All blocks that are used within a partition and marked as
     unallocated or freed in the Unallocated or Freed Bitmaps
     are flagged as errors.
  2) All blocks of which the verifier could not (yet) find the
     usage, but that are marked as allocated in the Unallocated
     and Freed Bitmaps are flagged as warnings.
     These are no UDF rule violations.

todo list for verifier implementation (incomplete list)
(at least the head of this list is in priority order)

- verify stream restrictions
- Space Tables for partition allocation checks
- File Link Count for non-directory FEs
- finish FID and FE testing
- Unallocated Space Descriptor checks
- symbolic link expansion
- Timestamps
- permissions
- Full UniqueID testing
- UDF 2.01
- ...

Please inform me of errors, etc. as soon as possible
in order to improve the verifier. Also in the case of
wrong or unclear UDF and ECMA references in messages.
