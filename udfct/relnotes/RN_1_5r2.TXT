Release notes for UDF verifier release 1.5r2

Changes since previous release 1.5r0

New/modified UDF tests:

- ...

Further changes/corrections:

- Crash repair if Allocation Unit Size or Alignment Unit Size have value zero.
- MAX VOLUME SIZE increased from 512 GB to 1 TB
- Reduce output and skip of unrecorded gaps in case of many read errors
  for -inspect_image and -write_image options, avoiding huge log files and elaps times.

Implementation changes/corrections/remarks:

- The separate module udf_scsi.dll was removed. The scsi stuff is now linked directly
  into udf_test.exe now (udf_test.exe still uses wnaspi32.dll).
- The executable generated on Windows XP was also tested on Windows Vista.
- Apart from the Unix Makefiles, also Visual Studio 2005 solution and project files are
  included in the delivery packet now (also suitable for Visual Studio Express Edition).
  Start Visual Studio using 'Solution file' src/udfct.sln, then set "udf_tester" as startup
  project.

- Set Visual Studio compiler flag to detect 64-bit compatibility issues and repaired all
  consequent compiler warnings.
- consequent use of uctExit() [instead of exit() or uctFatalExit()].
- include uct_core.h in scsiapi.c and use UCTASSERT(), remove LOCALASSERT().
- remove unused dead code

Known problems:

- Scsi support only accesses logical unit 0 of a drive.
- Strategy 4096 blocks may be flagged as unused blocks.
- For FE, Access, Modification and Attribute Date and Time,
  no compare (yet) to File Times EA Creation Time, if any.

------------

todo list for verifier implementation:
(incomplete list)

- double check UDF 2.50 errata tests
- complete UDF 2.60 testing and test on BD drives
- no Freed Space Bitmap/Table for access type 4.
- verify Previous VAT ICB location
- UniqueID mapping table tests
- symbolic link expansion
- Timestamps in Extended Attributes
- permissions
- ...
- check DCNs: 5157, 5163, 5166 ??


Please inform me of errors, missing tests, etc. as soon as
possible in order to improve the verifier. Also in the case
of wrong or unclear UDF and ECMA references in messages.
