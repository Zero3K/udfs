Release notes for UDF verifier release 0.8r5

Changes since release 0.8r2

- Added disclaimer at end of verifier output.
- Checking equivalence and consistency of Main VDS and
  Reserve VDS, according to ECMA 3/8.4.1 and 3/8.4.2.3.
  Many test images showed errors here, check !!
- Show VDS summary with descriptors VDS Number.
- Verify and show all Dstring fields.
  Many test images showed errors here, check !!
- Verify all OSTA CS0 Charspec fields

  Space Descriptor AD field.
- Overlapping partitions, nmb of PDs and partition maps.
- show verification start and elapsed time
- extra note in case of EntityID Flags UDF/DVD conflict
- From now also HP-UX binary delivered and tested
  (no HP-UX drive support)

Corrections:
- Change "UCT time" to "UTC time" in messages, this seems
  to be the official acronym.
  UDF  spec uses: "Coordinated Universal Time"
  ECMA spec uses: "Universal Coordinated Time"
- bug repair: in some cases, the verifier crashed
  if an 'out of range' partition reference number
  was found in an allocation descriptor.
- bug repair: the verifier crashed on certain errors
  when reading an Unallocated Space Entry.
- small error message corrections.

Some of the bugs repaired were brought to my attention
by verifier users, thanks for this feedback.

todo list for verifier implementation (incomplete list)
(at least the head of this list is in priority order)

- UniqueID testing by cross reference of all FID/FE
- UniqueID mapping table tests
- verify last stream restrictions
- symbolic link expansion
- finish FID and FE testing
- finish Volume Structure descriptors
- Timestamps in Extended Attributes

wrong or unclear UDF and ECMA references in messages.
