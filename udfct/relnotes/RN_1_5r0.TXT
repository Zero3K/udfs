Release notes for UDF verifier release 1.5r0

Changes since previous release 1.4r2

New/modified UDF tests:

- New test: UDF 3.3.5.1: "Named Streams and Stream Directories shall not have
  Extended Attributes.".
  MANY VIOLATIONS, so check your implementation !!
- Correction of (E)FE Checkpoint field test (must be > 0, ECMA 4/14.9.15).
  Because of a bug in the verifier, Checkpoint was never properly tested before,
  so this is also a new test in fact.
  MANY VIOLATIONS, so check your implementation !!
- Test UDF Defined Stream Names (3.3.7 and 3.3.8).
- Test FID Metadata bit for UDF Defined Streams (3.3.7 and 3.3.8).
- Test Named Stream Names, starting with "*UDF" (3.3.5.2).
- Error if end of VDS extent or LVID sequence extent outside volume space,
  also if this last secor is not read because of an earlier TD.

Non-functional changes/corrections:

- Bug repair: Verifier was hanging in 'far apart' calculation
  if VDS outside volume space.
- For Win32 binary generation upgraded to "Visual Studio 2005" using "Release"
  (instead of "Debug" version created by Visual Studio 7.1).
- restriction of 'message limit to 10' for some errors.
- Do not expand stream dirs for UDF 1.50 and 1.02

Known problems:

- Only logical unit 0 of a drive is accessed.
- Strategy 4096 blocks may be flagged as unused blocks.
- For FE, Access, Modification and Attribute Date and Time,
  no compare (yet) to File Times EA Creation Time, if any.

------------

todo list for verifier implementation:
(incomplete list)

- double check UDF 2.50 errata tests
- complete UDF 2.60 testing and test on BD drives
- no Freed Space Bitmap/Table for access type 4.
- verify Previous VAT ICB location
- UniqueID mapping table tests
- symbolic link expansion
- Timestamps in Extended Attributes
- permissions
- ...

Please inform me of errors, missing tests, etc. as soon as
possible in order to improve the verifier. Also in the case
of wrong or unclear UDF and ECMA references in messages.
