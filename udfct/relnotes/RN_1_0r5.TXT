Release notes for UDF verifier release 1.0r5

Changes since previous release 1.0r2

New tests, etc.:

- More UDF 2.50 tests.
- Show "Volume identifiers summary". Shows all Volume, Volume Set,
  Logical Volume and File Set Identifiers.
- Verify relation between LVD, FSD, IUVD and VAT2 Logical Volume Identifier.
- Verify USD extents defining free Volume Space.
- New tests for PVD and FSD (interchange levels, flags).
- Verify LVD LogicalBlockSize
- Recognize "*UDF VAT LVExtension" EA from UDF 1.50 errata as a
  valid UDF defined EA. Note that its content is not interpreted
  by the verifier.
- Test reserved field of Sparing Table.
- The overall file body CRC calculation algorithm is changed in such
  a way that its value is now independent of the order in which files
  and directories appear on a medium.
- Eliminated all 'level 4' compiler warnings (except 3 in udf_scsi.dll).
- Eliminated ENDIAN_SWAP definition, removed ENDIAN_SWAP from Makefile.uct.
  Dynamic endian determination and automatic swap now.
- Added header file dependencies to Makefile files.
- As we can expect to see more bigger media, the default message limit
  for a specific error or warning message is reduced from 100 to 20
  The message limit can be increased using the -mlimit option.
- Implemented simple read cache. Can be disabled using new
  "-nocache" option, e.g. for media with linkblocks mapped in
  volume space like CD-R or media with many read errors.
- Improved REAME.TXT and FAQ.TXT explanation and verifier -help output.
- Reorganized bin/* directories. These may now optionally contain make*.log
  files that show the exact test and compile platform data.
- A wnaspi32.dll ASPI driver for WinXP, Win2k and WinNT is now bundled
  with the UDF Verifier by courtesy of Ahead Software.
  For details and conditions of use, see the file bin/win32/ASPI.TXT.
- Added NetBSD scsi/Atapi support, but no NetBSD binaries in delivery
  (customize Makefele.uct to #define NETBSD).

For Linux and NETBSD:
- The -scsi option does now also accept any device path (e.g. /dev/xyz)
  as an argument besides the usual <h>:<s> drive identification.
- "-showscsi" and "-scsi <h>:<s>" only test the following devices:
  /dev/sg*, /dev/scd*, /dev/sd*, /dev/hd*, /dev/loop*, /dev/cd*
  (was: only dev/sg[0-128] and if none found, then /dev/sg[a-z]).
  Note that "-scsi <device path>" has no restrictions.

For Irix 64:
- Can verify from drive, but does not use scsi/Atapi.
  It handles a device in the same way as a file, e.g.: udf_test /dev/abc.
  (this was introduced in rel 1.0r2 already, but forgot to mention).

Corrections:

- Embedded EAs are allowed for the Metadata File, only an EA file is not allowed.
- Check overflow for descriptorCRCLength, it is an Uint16 and can therefore
  only cover e.g. 32 blocks of 2k !!! Problem for big ST and maybe SBD.
  Nothing in the UDF spec about what to do. Implemented the UDF 2.50 errata
  DCN-5108 that requires a value of MAX_UINT16 in this case.
- Corrected TagLocation test of embedded FIDS in a strategy 4096 File Entry.
- Changed some "Overruled Package Length" warning messages into an
  informal note.
- Correct UDF spec references in some cases where section numbers changed
  in newer UDF revisions.
- Change "Warning:" to "Note:" for final message on handling undefined Timezones.
- limit 'last valid block (N) correction' till first valid AVDP at N-256.
- VAT FE EAa and stream directory is not disallowed by UDF spec.
  Verifier shows now: A note for embedded EAs, a warning for EA file and
  an error for a stream directory in VAT EFE.
- Bigger default read buffer for -inspect_image and -write_image

Known problems:

- Not all UDF 2.50 specific tests are already implemented
- For drives with multiple logical units, only logical unit
  0 can be accessed.
- Strategy 4096 blocks may be flagged as unused blocks.
- For FE, Access, Modification and Attribute (Date and) Time,
  do not (yet) compare to File Times EA Creation Time, if any.
- Space Table with strategy type 4096 not implemented

------------

todo list for verifier implementation:
(incomplete list)

- complete UDF 2.50 testing
- no Freed Space Bitmap/Table for access type 4.
- timeout and timeout option for the time needed to determine
  the lastvalidblock value (in case of read errors).
- Unallocated Space Descriptor checks
- verify last stream restrictions
- finish Volume Structure descriptors
- verify if unused VAT entry is #FFFFFFFF (warn or error??)
- UniqueID mapping table tests
- symbolic link expansion
- finish Volume Structure descriptors
- Timestamps in Extended Attributes
- Space Table with strategy type 4096
- permissions
- ...

Please inform me of errors, etc. as soon as possible
in order to improve the verifier. Also in the case of
wrong or unclear UDF and ECMA references in messages.
