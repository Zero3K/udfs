Release notes for UDF verifier release 0.5r1

Changes since previous release 0.4r3

- Strategy 4096, first implementation.
- continue verifying after tag location error.
- Inconsistent use of "block" and "sector" in messages:
  changed all "sector" to "block".
- informal allocation descriptors log: do not count AD
  that points to next extent of ADs

- new option: -write_image <name>
  Write and inspect image. Writes output image file of input medium,
  block address 0 till 'last valid block' included.
  Output log shows position of all possible AVDP and VAT File Entry
  descriptors (check on tag id, tag checksum and FE file type only).
  Ignores all read error blocks at the end of an image and writes all
  other read error blocks (like unrecorded blocks, reserved tracks,
  etc.) as blank blocks (all #00 bytes).
  Usage example:
  udf_test -scsi 2:2 -write_image OSTA_V1_D6.img
  For more details see: udf_test -help

- new option: -inspect_image <start>
  Same as -write_image, but no image file output.
  Extra is definition of start address, which is always
  0 for -write_image. This allows for inspection of a
  part of the image only.

Not yet included in the verifier (incomplete list) :

- handle descriptors longer than the block size.
- Sparing
- File Link Count
- Extended Attributes
- Timestamps
- Full UniqueID testing
- allocated Space checks
- streams
- ...

First foreseen additions:

- descriptors longer than the block size.
- Sparing
- Complete the tests for FID and File Entry.

Please inform me of errors, etc. as soon as possible
in order to improve the verifier. Also in the case of
wrong or unclear UDF and ECMA references in messages.
