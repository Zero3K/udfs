Release notes for UDF verifier release 1.0r2

Changes since release 1.0r1

New tests, etc.:

- UDF 2.50 specific tests added, a.o.
  - test if metadata allocation is according to duplicate flag
  - test allocation and alignment of metadata extents
  - etc...
- for UDF 2.50+ :
  Use -packetlength option for defining the ECC length in blocks.
  If (ECC) packetlength is not defined by the drive OR
       on the command line OR in the image configuration file,
  then 16 will be used as the default (ECC) -packetlength value.

Corrections:

- Corrected Taglocation test for Metadata Bitmap File SBD.
  Test was wrong for non-embedded case.
- Correction of Byte Position in message for long_ad Partition
  Reference Number test.

Known problems:

- Not all UDF 2.50 specific tests are already implemented
- For drives with multiple logical units, only logical unit
  0 can be accessed.
- Strategy 4096 blocks may be flagged as unused blocks.
- For FE, Access, Modification and Attribute (Date and) Time,
  do not (yet) compare to File Times EA Creation Time, if any.
- Space Table with strategy type 4096 not implemented

------------

todo list for verifier implementation:
(incomplete list)
(at least the head of this list is in priority order)

- add specific UDF 2.50 tests
- no Freed Space Bitmap/Table for access type 4.
- timeout and timeout option for the time needed to determine
  the lastvalidblock value (in case of read errors).
- Unallocated Space Descriptor checks
- verify last stream restrictions
- finish Volume Structure descriptors
- verify if unused VAT entry is #FFFFFFFF (warn or error??)
- UniqueID mapping table tests
- symbolic link expansion
- finish Volume Structure descriptors
- Timestamps in Extended Attributes
- Space Table with strategy type 4096
- permissions
- finish special UDF 2.01 tests
- ...

Please inform me of errors, etc. as soon as possible
in order to improve the verifier. Also in the case of
wrong or unclear UDF and ECMA references in messages.

Regards, Gerrit Scholl.
