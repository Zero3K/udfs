Release notes for UDF verifier release 0.9r2

Changes since release 0.9r1

- verify all UniqueID, except the UniqueID mapping table
- new -showalloc option, shows lists of partition allocated
  and unused contiguous extents in partition summary.
- new "-dummysession <nblocks>" option, meant to be used as
  a placeholder for non-data sessions for Mixed Mode Multisession
  images. An implicite "-sessionstart <x>" option is inserted
  for the session following the dummy session.
  As usual see -help output for details.
- On -filecrc show file size as well, new format for file crc
  record in verifier output:
  <tab>file CRC: <path>, 0x<hex body crc>, <body byte size>
- show all hard links when verifying file link count.
- Timestamp checks: no more special handling of error Type 0.
  Mark erroneous timestamps with '*' in first position.
- Warning if timestamp UTC offset is not a multiple of 15 minutes.
- Reduced some fixed message limits in order to reduce output
  (e.g. from 500 to 20 for timestamp errors). Can be overruled
  by 'all infinite' message limit option: "-mlimit 0".
- show all EntityIDs for -mlimit 0 option ('all infinite'
  message limit).
- For a dirty Volume with an Open prevailing LVID but no
  virtual partition, the verifier will verify the volume
  as if the LVID were not Open in order to show all
  LVID and volume inconsistencies.
- Add fake file tail read for EA and VAT files and repair of
  incorrect file tail read for normal files.
  After file body read, also a fake file tail read is done
  in order to show the total file allocations.
- Show checksum and CRC values in messages as hex numbers.
- Instead of inspection of up to 450 last blocks before starting
  verification, first inspect only last valid block.
  If no AVDP or VAT found then inspect more blocks.
- Avoid reading reserved track for last valid block inspection.
- Improved check on inconsistent track information.
- Use Mt. Fuji READ TRACK/RZONE INFORMATION for Last Recorded
  Address, improvement for open DVD-R.

Corrections:

- Non-Allocatable Space Stream/List is not obligatory in case
  of a Sparable partition if the Sparing mapping area is not
  inside a partition.
- For a read-only partition, the LVID Free Space must be zero.
- For a non-sequential write once partition, the LVID Free
  Space can be less than (<partition size> - <number of allocated
  blocks>) because of unused blocks that have been used and
  recorded in the past.
- Uid and Gid check changed from error to warning because of
  "unless otherwise specified by the user." in UDF 3.3.3.1+2.
- Correction of size test for last EA in an EA Space.
- Repair failure on zero mapping size of Sparing Table,
  warning added.

Known problems:

- For drives with multiple logical units, only logical unit
  0 can be accessed.
- Strategy 4096 blocks may be flagged as unused blocks.

todo list for verifier implementation (incomplete list)
(at least the head of this list is in priority order)

- UniqueID mapping table tests
- verify last stream restrictions
- symbolic link expansion
- finish Volume Structure descriptors
- Timestamps in Extended Attributes
- Unallocated Space Descriptor checks
- Space Table with strategy type 4096
- permissions
- finish UDF 2.01 tests
- ...

Please inform me of errors, etc. as soon as possible
in order to improve the verifier. Also in the case of
wrong or unclear UDF and ECMA references in messages.

Regards, Gerrit Scholl.
