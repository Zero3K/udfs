UDF verifier package usage:

===============================================
Get the latest UDF verifier

from: http://www.hitech-projects.com/udf/

Read the README.TXT file.

The verifier is available for several platforms.

==== Windows platform:
see directories:
  bin/win32
  bin/win32-noscsi
  bin/win32-aspi

For verifying in a Windows environment from a medium in a drive
the following files are needed:
  bin/win32/udf_test.exe       ## the verifier
  bin/win32/udf_scsi.dll       ## the Scsi/Atapi functions, see note:
  bin/win32-aspi/wnaspi32.dll  ## Nero AG version, Vista, WinXP, Win2k, WinNT

Note: udf_scsi.dll is removed for verifier release 1.5r2 and higher.
      The scsi stuff is linked directly into udf_test.exe.

A wnaspi32.dll version for WinXP, Win2k and WinNT is bundled
with the UDF Verifier by courtesy of Nero AG.

For further details on wnaspi and terms and conditions for use of
the bundled wnaspi32.dll, see the file bin/win32-aspi/ASPI.TXT

Drive support in this way does not only work for SCSI drives,
but also for Atapi compatible IDE drives.

wnaspi32.dll is placed in a separate directory in order not to
interfer with other installed wnaspi32.dll versions in case the
verifier is runned directly from the bin/win32 directory.

If no scsi/atapi support is required, bin/win32-noscsi/udf_test.exe
is the only binary that is needed to verify from an image file.

==== other platforms:

For other platforms look in the appropriate bin/* directories.
Binaries with SCSI/Atapi support are only present for Windows and Linux.

Scsi/Atapi support is also implemented for NetBSD, but no binaries are
included.

For all other platforms: Customize udf_tester/Makefile.uct
and make ...

For Irix64, also drive support is implemented, Irix64 does not use
the scsi/atapi options of the verifier, but handles a device in the
same way as a file.
This may also work for other Unix-like platforms, e.g. for Linux.

For Sun Solaris and HP-UX, the UDF verifier can only verify from an
image file.

Binaries available in the delivery at the moment are for Windows, Linux,
Sun, HP, Irix64.

It should not be a problem to compile the verifier for other platforms
like Mac, BDS, ... (no drive support).

UDF verifier usage
------------------
The verifier is a command line program that verifies UDF images and
media for compliance with the UDF spec. UDF revisions 1.02 till 2.60
are supported. The verifier is aimed at UDF implementers and shows a
great deal of UDF details and logging.

First thing to do with the verifier is send the "udf_test -help"
output to a printer. This help information explains the verifier
options and the verifier output layout.

---------------
Verify a UDF file system in an image file
by: udf_test <image file path>

The <image file path> can be a list of chunks. Each chunk
with a size that is a multiple of the UDF block size and at
most 2 Terabyte minus one block (for platforms where no
'64 bit file size' code is used, the chunk limit is 2
Gbyte minus one block).
The total image file is the concatenation of all chunks in
command line order.

---------------
For UDF verification directly from a medium in a drive,
using scsi/atapi: first find the drive identification
by: udf_test -showscsi

A drive is identified by <host adapter>:<scsi id> (see help info).
Verify the disc in the drive identified by x:y
by: udf_test -scsi x:y

Note: since release 1.0r5 it is also possible for Linux and NetBSD
      to directly address any drive by: -scsc /dev/xxx

---------------
When the UDF verifier output is put in a file, the file can be
inspected for errors, warnings and notes by performing a case
insensitive search for "error:", "warning:" or "note:".

---------------
In case of questions or remarks about the verifier output,
please send an e-mail to the address below.
Please quote the appropriate part of the verifier output
or even better, send the full verifier output with your
e-mail as an attachment.
Feedback is highly appreciated and may lead to improvement of
the UDF verifier as well.

---------------
Code for adding drive support for specific platforms can be
added.Please contact me in that case.
Mind that these additions will not lead to a change in the
Licence rules as stated in LICENSE.TXT.
